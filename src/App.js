    bio: "I am a Full Stack Web Developer and Bloom Institute of Technology graduate. After making a career change from being a teacher, I began learning to code in early 2020. Although different fields, I have used my prior careerâ€™s learning experiences to guide me in my path as a Web Developer. During this time, I have developed strong skills in multiple languages, frameworks, and libraries. As I continue to develop my skills, I am looking forward to my first opportunity to provide value and gain additional knowledge in this industry.",
